#slicing basically we can collect the string part with diffrent ways 
#suppose we need to get only surname from hole name so like this 

name = "UDAY GAJANAN PAYGHON"

#here we using the slicing concept to get diffrent diffrent name :> 
print ("first name: ",name[0:4])#rem while 0 to3 will get as output 
print ("Middle Name: ",name[4:12])
print ("Last Name : ",name[13:])# this is something we can do like this

print (" ")
#now we using some diffrent way to name 
print("First name :", name[:4]) # here we give only one but it consider left all side
